# Bouncing-drops
Physics of bouncing drops. With a team of undergraduate students.
We use two (2) Arduino board the first one is used to get the acceleration values
and send it to the computer. The second one is used as a stroboscope light.
Two (2) scripts in Python are added, "Geta.py" is used to get the values send by 
the first Arduino board, "Eta.py"  is used to transform the values of acceleration
in volt to I.S units (m*s^-2).
These scripts are coded in Python 3, you need to install:
--pyserial
--numpy
--Tkinter
